🚀 Vicky Data Science Assistant Platform

📌 Overview

Vicky is an advanced, fully automated data science assistant designed to understand, match, and execute solutions for over 1000+ dynamically generated questions. Unlike traditional Q&A models, this system doesn’t rely on static categorization but dynamically extracts parameters, detects variations, and executes code efficiently.

🔥 Features

Dynamic Question Matching – No manual classification, pure intelligent processing.

Integrated API Execution – Automatically detects the required solution and runs it.

Smart File Handling – Upload, process, and reference files dynamically.

Webhook Notifications – Send updates to Discord, Slack, or Telegram.

Optimized Performance – Designed for fast execution with minimal latency.

🏗️ System Architecture

Backend: Python (FastAPI) + Advanced regex-based matching.

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript (lightweight UI for interaction).

Data Processing: JSON-based structured solution storage.

APIs: Seamlessly handles API requests with dynamic port allocation.

Security: IP logging, rate limiting, and file validation mechanisms.
